<p>On this website I use <code><a href="&#39;https://github.com/awhstin/awtools&#39;">awtools</a></code> which is a light (read not fully built) aesthetics package for all the charts and visuals. Every once in awhile I like to make tweaks so I thought I could take a minute to display some of the edits I made. Most the changes are to the color palettes, but there are a few spacing edits as well as tweaks to dark theme so why not makes a few charts. To do this we are going to need some data. Not too long ago I came across an article, <a href="&#39;https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/09/01/upshot/cost-of-hurricane-harvey-only-one-storm-comes-close.html?mcubz=1&#39;">The Cost of Hurricane Harvey: Only One Recent Storm Comes Close</a>, which was discussed at length on Twitter for its visualization merit and I have long been interested in the data so that seems like a great dataset to revisit.</p>

      col2 == &#39;#61c6e2&#39; ~ &#39;Winter Storm&#39;
    )

<p>Now that the data is grouped I think the first question I would want to answer is a simple one: what does the distribution of disasters look like? I will group by disasters then plot them along a timeline so why not also use the new <code>a_dark_theme</code> which is my default theme using the IBM Plex Mono with a dark background and a couple other minor tweaks. We can size by the cost of the disaster and try to see if we notice any trends.</p>
<div style="width:100%; background-color:#2a2a2a; padding:-20%">
<pre class="r"><code>ggplot(costs, aes(x=year,y=Disaster,color=Disaster))+
  ggbeeswarm::geom_quasirandom(alpha=.75,aes(size=cost),groupOnX = FALSE, show.legend = FALSE)+
  a_dark_theme() +
  a_main_color() +
  labs(title=&#39;Billion Dollar Natural Disasters&#39;,
       subtitle=&#39;The most costly naturdal disasters from 1980 - 2017&#39;,
       y=&#39;&#39;,
       caption=&#39;Data: New York Times\nOriginal Article: &quot;The Cost of Hurricane Harvey: Only One Recent Storm Comes Close&quot;&#39;)</code></pre>
<p><img src="/data-visualization/awtoolsdisaster_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-2-1.png" width="960" /></p>
</div>
<p>Although it looks like there may be a slight upward trend in number of disasters overall there are clear increases in the Drought/Fire and Storm groups. This makes me ask then what do these sorts of trends do to the cost of the disasters, maybe something like a running total of cost of disaster year over year.</p>
<p>We already have the data so let’s do it.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>total.cost &lt;- costs %&gt;%
  group_by(Disaster) %&gt;%
  arrange(Disaster,year) %&gt;%
  mutate(total = cumsum(cost))</code></pre>
<p>Now that we have the running total of cost we need to display it. I think some sort of hybrid line chart that also has points indicating the disasters themselves.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>#running total
ggplot(total.cost, aes(x=year,
                       y=total,
                       fill = Disaster, 
                       group = Disaster)) +   
  geom_line(size=.5,aes(color=Disaster)) +
  geom_point(aes(color=Disaster)) +
  a_plex_theme() +
  a_main_fill() +
  a_main_color() +
  labs(title=&#39;Natural Disasters and Runaway Cost&#39;,
       subtitle=&#39;Running total of cost of natural disasters (over $1 billion in estimated cost) from 1980 - 2017&#39;,
       caption=&#39;Data: New York Times\nOriginal Article: &quot;The Cost of Hurricane Harvey: Only One Recent Storm Comes Close&quot;&#39;)</code></pre>

<p>I see that the cost of hurricanes (even if I were to remove Katrina) have been rising a bit more rapidly than the other groups. Similarly we see that within the groups the steps seem to get larger since 2010.</p>
<p>My final question I want to ask of the data is a bit self serving and was inspired by this tweet.</p>

<p>In this release there are tons of awesome new features but one I wanted to try was the new marking geoms that are included. To do this I will grab the top ten disasters in cost by group and plot them out over the years.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>top.ten&lt;-costs %&gt;%
  group_by(Disaster) %&gt;%
  top_n(n = 10, wt = cost)

labels&lt;-costs %&gt;%
  group_by(Disaster) %&gt;%
  top_n(n = 1, wt = cost) %&gt;%
  filter(!Disaster %in% c(&#39;Winter Storm&#39;,&#39;Flooding&#39;))</code></pre>
<p>Now we can use the new <code>geom_mark_circle</code> to label a few.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>#running total
ggplot(top.ten, aes(x=year, y=cost, color = Disaster, group = Disaster)) +   
  geom_point() +
  geom_mark_circle(data=labels, aes(label=name,
                                    color=Disaster, 
                                    fill=NA),
                   label.family = &#39;IBM Plex Mono&#39;,
                   label.fontsize = 8,
                   label.fill = NA,
                   label.fontface = &#39;plain&#39;) +
  a_plex_theme() +
  a_main_fill() +
  a_main_color() +
  labs(title=&#39;Most Costly Disasters&#39;,
